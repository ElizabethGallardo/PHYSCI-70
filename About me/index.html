      <!<p> Welcome to me website! My name is Elizabeth Gallardo Hevia. 
      This page includes what I am most passionate about. Starting off with a picture of my family (dad, abuelo) and myself below: </p><br>

       <!<p> The website tours you around many of the project that I have worked on as a roboticist, designer, engineer. Besides those titles, I also consider myself a pianist, an athlete, Catholic, a dancer, and a music enthusiast amongst many others. 

      The projects displayed on this website exemplify some of the skills that I have mastered during graduate school. I hope you enjoy them as much as I enjoyed working on each one of them.
