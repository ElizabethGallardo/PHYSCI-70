  <h3>Final Project Proposal </h3> <br> 
  <div class="row">
    
      <!<p> The following are final project ideas. 
        <ol type="1">
          <li><b>Wearable device for soccer players:</b> to improve individual performance or overall game tactics. </li>
          <li><b> Small-scale soft piston:</b> using new fabrication techniques to scale down soft piston design (continuation of my PhD project). </li>
          <li><b> Educational device:</b> that demonstrates many simple mechanisms within one entity. In addition, all mechanisms will be fabricated differently. </li>
          <li><b> Focus band: </b> stimulates you every 30 minutes so that you can focus on work without interruption. The goal is to block out interruption that comes from looking at your phone for time. </li>
        </ol>

<br>The final project idea I am most excited about is the first one. I want to develop a wearable device to be used by professional athletes to improve their game tactics. My passion is soccer and for that reason would like to make a wearble specifically for soccer players. 
The device will take data of individual athletes.  After a thorough literature and market search, I will determine what metrics are most sought out. For example, we may be interested in physiological metrics such as heart rate or kinematic information such as joint angles. 
This device will require various of the topics learned in PHYSCI-70 in order to complete. The project will most likely integrate electronic input and output devices, Molding and Casting, Composites and sewing, and Computer Programming. I may be able to leverage hand tools and CNC milling if I want to make very precise features in molds that cannot be accomplished with a 3D printer. I am less familiar with IoT but would love to brainstorm ways of incorporating it in the device once I learn more.   </p>
